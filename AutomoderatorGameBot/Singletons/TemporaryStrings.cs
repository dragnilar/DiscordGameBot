Her eyes are the universe convering in two small points and asking a question of my existence, and it is a resounding yes. If the greatest sculptor in world history labored to create the perfect face for 23 years, and then saw her, he would retire his craft and admit that nature is a greater power than can ever be controlled. If she spoke to me on the street I would burst out in tears and run away, knowing such beauty is more than any one person could deserve, especially one such as myself. But she would chase after me and ask if Im alright, and Id continue bawling, until she left awkwardly, and my heart would be forever broken for acting like an idiot,  but forever mended for seeing such brilliance in person.";
