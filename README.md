# DiscordGameBot
A silly game bot in .NET Core that I created for myself. The game itself is mostly unimplemnted at this point as it's mostly used for other dumb purposes.

I still work on this occasionaly but it is not intended to be a significant time investment. 

If you are curious, this can be used as an example for the following:

- Using DSharpPlus for interaction with the Discord API

- Working in a predominantly Asynchronous environment

- Handling configuration using both Excel and SQL Server

- Using Entity Framework Core

- Creating a very silly application.
