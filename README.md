# DiscordGameBot
A silly game bot in .NET Core that I created for myself and my friends Discord Server. 

I unfortunately never got around to fully implementing the game due to time constraints and also lack of interest from my friends.

This is now archived since I quit using Discord and do not have any plans on resuming development or returning to Discord.

In the very least, you can use it as an example for the following:

- Using DSharpPlus for interaction with the Discord API

- Working in a predominantly Asynchronous environment

- Handling configuration using both Excel and SQL Server

- Using Entity Framework Core

- Creating a very silly application.
